Popcorn recipe:
Put a pan od moderate size on top of stove and add olive or cocnut oil (vegetable oil will not work for this!)
Measure out anywhere between 1/4 to 1/2 cup of popcorn kernals and drop into the pan.
Adjust heat to medium-high
Put lid over pan and wait until there is about 5 seconds left between each pop (~5min)
Transfer the fresh popcorn into a bowl
